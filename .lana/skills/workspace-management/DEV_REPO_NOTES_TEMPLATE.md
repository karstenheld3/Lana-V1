# NOTES

## MUST-NOT-FORGET

- [PROMPTSYSTEM_FOLDER] is the source of truth. Never edit [AGENT_FOLDER] directly
- Sync order: 1) [PROMPTSYSTEM_FOLDER] → [AGENT_FOLDER] (robocopy /MIR), 2) [AGENT_FOLDER] → [LINKED_REPOS] (sync.ps1 -execute). Stage 2 requires stage 1 complete. Stage 3 (linked repo local mirror) is NOT automatic from source repo
- Downstream repos pull from [AGENT_FOLDER], NOT from [PROMPTSYSTEM_FOLDER]. The local mirror is the published source for linked repos
- Use placeholders in all workspace/session files, never ephemeral version strings or repo names

## Project Info

- Project name: [project-name]

<!-- Instructions: Replace placeholder values with your project information. -->

## Workspace Constants

[WORKSPACE_FOLDER]: `[current workspace root path]`
- Root folder of the workspace. All other paths compose from this.

[WORKSPACE_FILE]: `[WORKSPACE_FOLDER]\main.code-workspace`
- WORKSPACE mode only. Omit if SINGLE-PROJECT or MONOREPO.

<!-- Conditional: Omit the following constants for GENERAL workspaces (WS-CT-09). -->

[PRODUCT_REPO_FOLDER]: `[WORKSPACE_FOLDER]\..\[product-repo-name]`
- Product repository folder. In SINGLE-PROJECT mode, equals [WORKSPACE_FOLDER]. In WORKSPACE mode, may be outside [WORKSPACE_FOLDER].

[PRODUCT_SOURCE_FOLDER]: `[PRODUCT_REPO_FOLDER]\src`
- Source code folder. Applies to ProductRepo only.

[PRODUCT_DOCS_FOLDER]: `[PRODUCT_REPO_FOLDER]\docs`
- Product documentation folder.

[PRODUCT_VERSION]: `X.Y`
- Current product version. Format: `X.Y`, `X.Y.Z`, or `YYYY-MM-DD`. Used to compose version-dependent folder names and for release version extraction.

[DEV_KNOWLEDGE_FOLDER]: `[WORKSPACE_FOLDER]\knowledge`
- Knowledge bundles folder (synced from upstream in SYNCED repos).

[DEV_SPECS_FOLDER]: `[WORKSPACE_FOLDER]\specs`
- Specs folder containing shared specifications, design guidelines, SOPs.

[AGENT_FOLDER]: `[WORKSPACE_FOLDER]\.devin`
- Agent config folder. Sync target — copy of PromptSystem source content.

[SESSIONS_FOLDER]: `[WORKSPACE_FOLDER]\_PrivateSessions_gitignore`
- Base folder for session folders.

[SESSION_ARCHIVE_FOLDER]: `[SESSIONS_FOLDER]\..\Archive`
- Archive folder for closed sessions.

[SKILL_TOOLS_FOLDER]: `[WORKSPACE_FOLDER]\..\.tools\`
- Command line tools used by various PromptSystem skills. Shared across workspaces.

[API_KEYS_FILE]: `[SKILL_TOOLS_FOLDER]\.api-keys.txt`
- API keys file for skill scripts. Pass via `--keys-file [API_KEYS_FILE]`.

<!-- Conditional: Required for SYNCED only. Remove if SELF-CONTAINED. -->

[COMPANY_REPO_FOLDER]: `[WORKSPACE_FOLDER]\..\Company`
- Company repository folder (upstream source for knowledge and specs).

[KNOWLEDGE_SOURCE_FOLDER]: `[COMPANY_REPO_FOLDER]\knowledge`
- Upstream knowledge source. Sync target is [DEV_KNOWLEDGE_FOLDER].

[SPECS_SOURCE_FOLDER]: `[COMPANY_REPO_FOLDER]\specs`
- Upstream specs source. Sync target is [DEV_SPECS_FOLDER].

<!-- Release constants: Required for /project-release workflow. -->

[SOPS_FILE]: `SOPS.md`
- SOPS filename in workspace root.

[RELEASE_NOTES_FOLDER]: `[PRODUCT_DOCS_FOLDER]\ReleaseNotes`
- Release notes directory. Naming: `RELEASE_NOTES_v{VERSION}_{DATE}.md`.

<!-- Instructions:
- Replace [product-repo-name] with your product repository folder name
- Adjust [COMPANY_REPO_FOLDER] if your company folder is in a different location
- All paths should be relative to [WORKSPACE_FOLDER]
- [WORKSPACE_FILE] is the main.code-workspace file that defines which repos belong to the workspace
- Repos referenced in it may be physically outside [WORKSPACE_FOLDER] (e.g., ../ProductRepo)
- Omit [WORKSPACE_FILE] in SINGLE-PROJECT and MONOREPO modes
- Remove the SYNCED-only constants if your repo is SELF-CONTAINED (no external sync sources)
- [PROMPTSYSTEM_FOLDER] is repo-specific — compose as [WORKSPACE_FOLDER]\PromptSystem[PRODUCT_VERSION] in NOTES.md -->

<!-- Conditional: Remove this entire section if SELF-CONTAINED (no external sync sources). -->

## Sync Sources

### How Syncing Works

Sync configuration lives in `promptsystem-sync.json` at `[WORKSPACE_FOLDER]` root (PULL model). This file defines:
- **targets** array: each entry is self-contained (path, source, include, exclude, never_overwrite)
- **deprecated**: top-level array (shared across all targets in repo)
- Source is purely a content provider — no config at source

The `sync.ps1` script in `@skills:workspace-management` performs the actual sync. Always preview with `-diff` before executing.

### Sync Order (3 stages)

1. **[PROMPTSYSTEM_FOLDER] → local [AGENT_FOLDER]** — robocopy /MIR (after every edit to source)
2. **[AGENT_FOLDER] → [LINKED_REPOS]** — sync.ps1 -execute at each target (explicit user confirmation only). Source for targets: `../[source-repo]/[AGENT_FOLDER]`
3. **[LINKED_REPOS] local mirror** — robocopy /MIR at each linked repo (NOT automatic from source repo)

### Usage Examples

Preview changes (no files modified):
```powershell
& sync.ps1 -diff -config "promptsystem-sync.json"
```

Apply changes (copies, overwrites, deletes deprecated files):
```powershell
& sync.ps1 -execute -config "promptsystem-sync.json"
```

Or use the `/sync` workflow which wraps these commands.

<!-- Instructions:
- Adjust source paths in promptsystem-sync.json if your PromptSystem source is in a different location
- All include/exclude, deprecated, and never_overwrite patterns are defined in promptsystem-sync.json
- See WSKMGMT-SP01 section 10 for the JSON schema -->

## Prevention Rules (from session fails)

<!-- Instructions: Add project-specific prevention rules here. These are lessons learned from session failures that must be applied going forward. Each rule has a bold label and a one-line description. -->

- **No Ask Tool**: NEVER use the `ask_user_question` tool. Resolve ambiguity through prompt analysis, not interactive prompts. See `agent-behavior.md` Attitude section.

<!-- Conditional: Omit Build/Test, Runtime Environment, and Release Configuration for GENERAL workspaces (WS-CT-09). -->

## Build/Test Rules

- Build command: [build-command]
- Test command: [test-command]
- Lint command: [lint-command]

<!-- Instructions: Define commands for building, testing, and linting your product repo. -->

<!-- Conditional: Applies to ProductRepo only. DevRepo and CompanyRepo are exempt (no buildable source code). -->

## Scripts

<!-- Instructions: List all build, test, deploy, and utility scripts. Include batch file wrappers and what they do. Omit section if no scripts. -->

**Build/Compile:**
- `[script-name].bat` — [description]

**Test:**
- `[script-name].bat` — [description]

**Deploy:**
- `[script-name].bat` — [description]

**Configuration:**
- `[script-name].bat` — [description]

## Runtime Environment

- Runtime: [node|bun|deno|python|rust|zig]
- Version file: [.nvmrc|.python-version|rust-toolchain.toml|build.zig.zon]
- Environment dir: [node_modules|.venv|target|zig-cache]
- Activate command: [n/a for rust/zig|.venv\Scripts\activate for python|fnm use for node]

<!-- Instructions:
- Every ProductRepo must use a local environment
- See LOCAL_ENVIRONMENTS.md in workspace-management skill for setup details
- Pin runtime version in a committed version file
- Gitignore the environment directory -->

<!-- Conditional: Omit for GENERAL workspaces. -->

## Full Stack and Dependencies

<!-- Instructions: List the full technology stack, key dependencies, and lock files. Omit section if no product code. -->

**Stack:**

<!-- Instructions: Record key architecture and design decisions. Include date and rationale. Omit section if no significant decisions. -->

- **[Decision title]** ([date]): [decision and rationale]

## Source Control

<!-- Instructions: Document what is tracked vs gitignored, git conventions, and any special gitignore patterns. Omit section if standard git workflow. -->

**Tracked in git:**
- [what is tracked]

**Gitignored:**
- [what is gitignored and why]

**Git conventions:**
- `_gitignore` suffix: Append `_gitignore` before extension to exclude files/folders from git without editing `.gitignore`. Patterns `*_gitignore.*` and `*_gitignore/` already in `.gitignore`.

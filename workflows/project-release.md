# Project Release Workflow

Create a config-driven project release supporting single-repo and multi-repo workspaces. All release parameters are read from `[RELEASE_CONFIG]` in workspace NOTES.md. Zero hardcoded paths, repo names, or version formats.

**Spec**: `_SPEC_RELEASE_PROJECT_WORKFLOW.md [RLSPROJ-SP01]`

## MUST-NOT-FORGET

1. ONE workflow file serves ALL workspace types - no per-repo customization of the workflow itself
2. All release configuration lives in workspace NOTES.md under `[RELEASE_CONFIG]` section
3. Detect workspace context first (single-repo vs multi-repo), then branch correctly
4. Product repo is always released first, dev repo second (if configured)
5. Agent MUST NOT execute build tools (build.bat, build.ps1, cargo, etc.) - user builds, agent verifies
6. Post-release version bump is mandatory, automatic, and the LAST step - never ask for confirmation
7. Read SOPS file (name from config) for workspace-specific procedures and deviations
8. No git tag is created before release notes are committed to the product repo
9. No GitHub release is created without explicit user confirmation
10. All paths in config use workspace constants - no absolute paths

## Prerequisites

- `[RELEASE_CONFIG]` section exists in workspace NOTES.md (or `!NOTES.md`)
- All configured repos have clean git worktree (no uncommitted changes)
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated (or provide manual release URL)

## Context Detection

Before any release steps, detect workspace context:

1. Detect workspace mode: `main.code-workspace` exists in workspace root → WORKSPACE mode (multi-repo), else → SINGLE-PROJECT or MONOREPO
2. Read `[RELEASE_CONFIG]` from workspace NOTES.md (or `!NOTES.md`)
3. If no `[RELEASE_CONFIG]` section: error and halt. Guide user to add config using `DEV_REPO_NOTES_TEMPLATE.md` from `@skills:workspace-management`
4. Count `[RELEASE_REPO]` blocks: 1 → single-repo flow, 2+ → multi-repo flow
5. Validate config (see Config Validation below)
6. Verify all configured repos have clean worktree: `git -C [repo_path] status --porcelain` must return empty. If any repo is dirty: halt and report which files are uncommitted in which repo
7. Read SOPS file (name from config `sops_file` key) for workspace-specific procedures and deviations
8. Resolve all workspace constants in repo paths (e.g., `[WORKSPACE_FOLDER]`, `[PRODUCT_REPO_FOLDER]`, `[PROMPTSYSTEM_FOLDER]`)

## Config Validation

After parsing `[RELEASE_CONFIG]`, validate before proceeding:

- Required global keys MUST be present: `sops_file`, `sessions_folder`, `release_notes_dir`
- Each `[RELEASE_REPO]` block MUST have all required keys: `path`, `role`, `tag_format`, `version_source`, `post_release_bump`
- Enum values MUST be valid:
  - `tag_format` in [`date`, `semver`]
  - `role` in [`product`, `dev`]
  - `version_source` in [`promptsystem_folder`, `pyproject_toml`, `package_json`, `none`]
  - `post_release_bump` in [`promptsystem_rename`, `patch_bump`, `minor_bump`, `none`]
- Conditional keys MUST be present when parent key requires:
  - `version_file` when `version_source` is `pyproject_toml` or `package_json`
  - `binary_path_pattern` when `binary_build` is `true`
- If validation fails: report specific missing or invalid key and halt

## Version Extraction

- `promptsystem_folder`: Parse `[PRODUCT_VERSION]: X.Y` from NOTES.md, extract `X.Y`
- `pyproject_toml`: Parse `version = "X.Y.Z"` from configured `version_file`
- `package_json`: Parse `"version": "X.Y.Z"` from configured `version_file`
- `none`: No version extraction; tag is the version identifier

## Tag Derivation

- `date` format: `YYYY-MM-DD` from current date (or user-specified date)
- `semver` format: `vX.Y.Z` from version source. Version source file must already contain the target release version (user bumps via SOPS procedure or manual edit before invoking workflow)

## Test Command Lookup

For each repo, `test_command` lookup order:
1. `[RELEASE_REPO]` config in `[RELEASE_CONFIG]`
2. `## Build/Test Rules` section in NOTES.md
3. Skip tests for that repo, log "no test command configured"

## Session Inventory

Find all session folders in configured `sessions_folder`:

1. List directories in `sessions_folder`, exclude any whose name contains `Archive`
2. For each session folder, collect:
   - Session name and date (from folder name or NOTES.md)
   - Goal (from session NOTES.md `## Session Info` section)
   - Status (from session PROGRESS.md - complete or in-progress)
   - Artifacts: `_INFO_*.md`, `_SPEC_*.md`, `_IMPL_*.md`, `__STRUT_*.md`, scripts
   - Key findings (from session NOTES.md `## Important Findings` section)
3. Session inventory runs against the repo containing the sessions folder (typically dev repo in multi-repo mode)

## Release Notes Template

The workflow uses this standard template (defined by the workflow, not per-workspace):

```markdown
# Release Notes: [TAG]

## Summary

This release covers [N] sessions from [date range], focusing on [themes].

## Sessions Overview

### [N]. [Session_Name]

**Goal**: [from session NOTES.md]

**Outcome**: [summary of what was achieved]

**Artifacts:**
- `[filename]` - [description]

**Key Findings:** (if any)
- [finding 1]
- [finding 2]

---

[Repeat for each session]

## New Skills Deployed

[List any new skills added to agent folder]

## New Workflows

[List any new workflows added to agent folder]

## Workspace Files

[List changes to workspace-level files: FAILS.md, NOTES.md, etc.]

## Statistics

- **Total Sessions**: [N]
- **Total Documents Created**: [N]
- [Other relevant stats]
```

Default naming: `RELEASE_NOTES_v{VERSION}_{DATE}.md` (configurable via `release_notes_naming`)
Default tag annotation: `Release {TAG}: {SUMMARY}` (configurable via `tag_annotation_template`)

## Version Consistency Gate

When `version_gate` is `true` for a repo, verify version alignment before tagging:

1. Check version source file version matches planned tag version
2. Check binary filename version matches (when `binary_build` is true)
3. Check binary `--version` output matches (when `binary_build` is true)
4. Check planned git tag matches version source

If binary cannot execute (non-zero exit, file not found, permission denied): report as "binary not runnable" (distinct from version mismatch), halt, and instruct user to verify binary platform compatibility.

If version mismatch: halt and instruct user to rebuild.

## Post-Release Version Bump

After all tags pushed and GitHub releases created (or skipped), execute post-release bump automatically without asking for user confirmation. This is not a discretionary step.

Bump strategy per repo:

- `promptsystem_rename`: Read current version from NOTES.md, increment minor, rename `PromptSystemVX.Y` folder to `PromptSystemVX.Y+1`, update NOTES.md, sync to `.devin/`, commit, push. Follow SOPS SOP 7 or equivalent procedure in workspace's SOPS file
- `patch_bump`: Read version from `version_file`, increment patch, write back, commit, push
- `minor_bump`: Read version from `version_file`, increment minor, reset patch to 0, write back, commit, push
- `none`: Skip

Bumped changes MUST be committed and pushed.

## Failure Recovery

### Principles

- Never delete remote tags. Tags on `origin` are immutable - treat as published
- Never force-push tags. A moved tag breaks downstream consumers
- When in doubt: halt and report. Agent MUST NOT attempt destructive recovery without user guidance

### Release notes commit failed
- Detection: `git commit` returns non-zero
- Recovery: Abort release. Release notes file may be staged but uncommitted. User fixes issue and re-invokes workflow. Re-run detects no tag exists, re-commits notes

### Tag creation failed (local)
- Detection: `git tag` returns non-zero
- Recovery (single-repo): Abort. No tag exists locally or remotely. User fixes issue and re-invokes
- Recovery (multi-repo): Delete all locally created tags from this run. Abort. User fixes issue and re-invokes

### Tag push failed
- Detection: `git push` returns non-zero
- Recovery: Local tag exists but remote does not. Check if remote tag exists at same commit. If yes: log "tag already on remote", continue. If no: retry push once. If retry fails: abort, report push error, leave local tag in place. User resolves remote issue and re-invokes

### GitHub release creation failed
- Detection: `gh release create` returns non-zero or `gh` not installed
- Recovery: Tags are already pushed (immutable). Report failure reason. If `gh` not installed: provide manual release URL (`https://github.com/[OWNER]/[REPO]/releases/new?tag=[TAG]`). User creates release manually. Post-release bump proceeds regardless - GitHub release is not a gate for version bump

### Post-release bump failed
- Detection: Version file write fails, folder rename fails, or commit/push fails
- Recovery: Tags and GitHub releases (if created) are immutable. Report failure. If folder rename partially completed: user manually finishes rename and updates NOTES.md. If version file write failed: no state changed, user fixes and re-invokes. If commit failed: user resolves and commits manually. Re-run detects existing tag, skips tagging, retries bump

## Idempotency

- Re-running workflow after partial failure MUST detect existing tags and skip re-tagging
- Re-running after GitHub release created MUST detect existing release and skip
- Before creating any tag: check if tag already exists locally and on remote. If tag exists at same commit: skip. If at different commit: halt and report conflict
- Before creating GitHub release: check if release already exists for tag. If exists: skip

## Logging

- Announce each phase before executing: context detection, tests, release notes, build, version gate, tagging, GitHub release, bump
- Report success or failure of each step with specific details (tag name, release URL, binary path)
- Error messages MUST state what failed, why, and recovery action
- Final report MUST be emitted in chat, not to a file
